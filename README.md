# Password Tester
A place to experiment with various password validation settings. Easily hosted on github pages or any spare webserver. 

Open index.html in a browser and try different passwords to get a feel for how the current settings will affect the strength meter.

Strength caclulation is done in password_checker.js. Try changing some of the default level values to see what impact it has.

DISCLAIMER: The author does not in any way suggest that the default settings in this project are 'secure', or that those settings are appropriate for use in any real world applications! The appropriate password policy for a given application will depend on many factors, and there is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution. 

I recommend visiting the zxcvbn library on github (https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn/) for more information.
