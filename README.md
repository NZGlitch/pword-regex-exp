# Password Tester
A place to experiment with various password validation settings. Easily hosted on github pages or any spare webserver. 

Open index.html in a browser and try different passwords to get a feel for how the current settings will affect the strength meter.

Strength caclulation is done in password_checker.js. Try changing some of the default level values to see what impact it has.
